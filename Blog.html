          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            As we are in the digital era, security is of paramount importance
            due to several factors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pervasive Connectivity</li>
            <li>Data Proliferation</li>
            <li>Rapid Technological Advancements</li>
            <li>Globalization and Remote Work</li>
            <li>Cybercrime and Threat Landscape</li>
            <li>Regulatory Compliance and Data Privacy</li>
            <li>Trust and Reputation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Security is vital to mitigate cybersecurity risks, protect sensitive
            data, comply with regulations, maintain trust and reputation, and
            ensure the resilience of digital infrastructure and services.
            Organizations must adopt a proactive and holistic approach to
            cybersecurity to address the evolving threats and challenges of the
            digital landscape effectively.

          <p class="about-desc">
            Ethical Hacking, also known as white-hat hacking, involves
            authorized attempts to bypass security measures to identify
            vulnerabilities. It's primary goal is to improve the security
            posture of systems and networks by uncovering weaknesses before
            malicious attackers exploit them.

          <h1>Steganography</h1>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information
            within an ordinary, non-secret file or message in order to avoid
            detection. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on securing the
            contents of a message, steganography aims to hide the existence of
            the message itself. The word "steganography" is derived from the
            Greek words "steganos"(covered) and "graphie"(writing).
          </p>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Steganography has a long history dating back to ancient times when
            secret messages were hidden in wax tablets or tattooed onto the
            shaven heads of messengers. During World War ll, invisible ink and
            microdots were used for covert communication.
          </p>

          <h3>Techniques</h3>
          <p>Common steganography techniques include -</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Least Significant Bit(LSB) insertion : Altering the least
              significant bits of pixels in an image or audio file to encode
              hidden information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spread Spectrum : Embedding data by slightly modifying the colour
              or amplitude of pixels or samples in digital media.
            </li>
            <li>
              Text-based steganography : Concealing messages within whitespace,
              formatting, or other non-printing characters in text documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              File-based steganography : Hiding data within the structure of
              files, such as adding extra space between letters in a document.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Detection</h3>
          <p>
            Detecting steganography poses significant challenges due to the
            subtle nature of hidden data. Specialized steganalysis techniques,
            such as statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and visual
            inspection,are employed to detect the presence of hidden information
            in digital media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, steganography is a powerful and evolving technique for
            covert communication and data hiding in the digital age, with
            implications for security, privacy, and forensic investigation.

          <h1>Dark Web</h1>
          <p>
            It refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed by
            traditional search engines and requires special software or
            configurations to access. It is often associated with illicit
            activities, including the buying and selling of drugs, weapons,
            stolen data, and other illegal goods and services. However, it also
            serves legitimate purposes, such as providing anonymity and privacy
            for whistleblowers, journalists, and activists in repressive
            regimes.
